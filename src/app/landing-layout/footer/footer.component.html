      <h4>11. TERMINATION </h4>
      <p>The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or by Marketplace Operator
        as set out below.</p>
      <p>Termination of these Terms does not affect any contract that has been formed between
        Contractors and Customers. A Subscriber must comply with the terms of any contract
        entered including providing any products or services.</p>
      <p>If you wish to terminate the Terms, you may do so by:</p>
      <ol type="a">

          target="_blank">Contact Us</a>' link on
        our homepage.</p>

        Subscription. You will be billed for the full term of your Subscription and continue to have
        access to the Services if you terminate your agreement prior to the end of your Subscription,unless your
        Subscriber Account has been terminated unilaterally by Marketplace Operator

      <ol type="a">
        <li>you have breached any provision of the Terms;</li>
        <li>Marketplace Operator is required to do so by law; or</li>
        <li>the provision of the Services to you by Marketplace Operator is, in the opinion of
          Marketplace Operator, no longer commercially viable.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Marketplace Operator reserves the right to discontinue or cancel your Subscriber Account
        at any time and may suspend or deny, in its sole discretion, your access to the Platform or
        the Services without notice if you breach any provision of the Terms or any applicable law
        or if your conduct impacts Marketplace Operator' name, goodwill or reputation or violates
        the rights of another party.</p>

    <div class="marketplace-boxs">
      <h4>12. DISPUTES </h4>
      <p>Contractors and Customers are solely responsible for interactions and disputes with each
        other. You agree that Platform Operator operates to connect Contractors and Customers to
        facilitate the provision of the Services. Platform Operator is not a supplier of any products
        or services that Contractors offer on this Platform nor is Platform Operator a party to any
        contracts entered between Contractor and Customer.
      </p>
      <p>Marketplace Operator reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between
        Contractors and Customers although may involve itself in such a dispute for the purpose of
        improving the user experience of the Platform and Services.</p>
      <p>If a dispute arises out of or relates to the Terms as between Marketplace Operator and a
        Subscriber, either party may not commence any Tribunal or Court proceedings in relation
        to the dispute, unless the following clauses have been complied with (except where urgent
        interlocutory relief is sought).</p>
      <p>A party claiming that a Dispute has arisen shall notify each other party to the Dispute giving
        details of the Dispute. During the 30-day period after a notice is given (or longer period
        agreed in writing by the Parties to the Dispute) (Initial Period) each party to the Dispute
        (Disputant) covenants with the other to cooperate and take all reasonable steps necessary
        to attempt to resolve the Dispute. If the Disputants are unable to resolve the Dispute within
        the Initial Period, each Disputant agrees that the Dispute shall be referred for mediation, at
        the request of any Disputant, to:</p>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>a mediator agreed on by the Disputants; or</li>
        <li>if the Disputants are unable to agree on a mediator within seven days after the end of
          the Initial Period, then the Parties must submit the dispute for mediation through the
          Chair of Resolution Institute (ACN 008 651 232) or the Chair’s designated
          representative and the Resolution Institute Mediation Rules shall apply to the
          mediation.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The role of any mediator is to assist in negotiating a resolution of the Dispute. A mediator
        may not make a decision that is binding on a Disputant unless that Disputant has so agreed
        in writing. Any information or documentation disclosed by a Disputant under this clause shall
        be kept confidential and may not be used except to attempt to resolve the Dispute. Each
        Disputant shall pay its own costs of complying with this clause. The Disputants shall pay equally the costs of
        any mediator engaged. The mediation will be held in Sydney, Australia,
        within 30 days after expiry of the Initial Period. Each Disputant agrees to attend the
        mediation by a representative having full authority to resolve the dispute. At the mediation
        each Disputant may be represented by one or more legal representative.</p>
      <p>If the dispute fails to resolve at mediation or if one of the Disputants fails or refuses to attend
        the mediation, the mediator will be requested to inform each Disputant in writing that the
        mediation has been terminated without resolution (Mediation Termination Notice). Upon
        receipt of Mediation Termination Notice, the dispute resolution process will be terminated.
        A party to a dispute will only be entitled to pursue other remedies available to it at law or
        otherwise, after receipt of Mediation Termination Notice. All communications concerning
        negotiations made by the Disputants arising out of and in connection with this dispute
        resolution clause are confidential and to the extent possible, must be treated as “without
        prejudice” negotiations for the purpose of applicable law of evidence.</p>
